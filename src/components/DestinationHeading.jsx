              Pakistan is a great place for tourism as it has the most appealing
              views of mountains and deserts. Especially, Swat, Hunza, Ayubia,
              Abbottabad, Murrree, Naran and Kaghan have yet been known as the
              ideal tourists spot for both summer and winter season.
